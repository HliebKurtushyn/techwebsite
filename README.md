# Web site of technical service

## Project Idea
> Create a website for submitting tech repair requests online. The site should implement registration/authentication for both customers and administrators. Customers will be able to submit repair requests with descriptions and optional photos of the issue. Administrators should be able to process user requests and send replies. If a customer's issue is fully resolved, administrators should send a corresponding ticket with information about the resolution and confirmation of the provided technical service.

> Customers must have access to the status of their request: 'pending', 'in progress', 'completed'. The status of all requests should be available both on the website and via a Telegram bot, if the customer chooses to use that option.

### Wishes
> - "It would be nice if technicians could add repair notes."
> - "It would be great if the system reminded about important events."
> - "Customers often ask about warranties — maybe store documents?"
> - "Our suppliers could also have access to the system."
